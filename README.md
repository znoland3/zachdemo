# About
This is a fairly simple application I built over a weekend from scratch. It does not have any real world purpose and is meant to demonstrate some of my programming abilities. It is completely object-oriented, mobile friendly, and fully deployed. It allows you to scrape websites and get a breakdown of elements and their text contents. At some point in the future, I will likely add the ability to create an account, save scrapes and compare previous scrape results against each other, export the results into Excel, dynamically filter on-page with Ajax, and drill down further into the results with more complex charts. 

The website can be accessed here - http://162.243.134.81/

An overview of how it was built is below.
